My vision for this project is a mobile-first journaling app that you can record entries to through voice recordings.

I personally have always been interested in journaling but don't enjoy the process of manually writing journal entries.

I want to be able to record quick thoughts about how my day went on my phone - the lowest-friction workflow possible to record thoughts.

Eventually I would like to implement an AI system that analyzes multiple journal entries and surfaces insights and suggestions, but that is a future feature.
